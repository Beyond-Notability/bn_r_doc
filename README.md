# Beyond Notability R code and documentation


This repository documents some of the code written by [Sharon Howard](https://sharonhoward.org) as Digital Humanities Research Fellow for the project [Beyond Notability](https://beyondnotability.org) in 2023-24. 

The general purpose of the repository is not to exhaustively document every piece of publicly shared code produced for the project, 
but rather to provide some background and explanation of the choices I made and examples of the way I went about working with the project data.

The [Wikibase](https://wikiba.se/) and Wikibase.cloud infrastructure used by the project has considerable potential for digital humanities/history projects that lack the substantial funding/skills needed to develop bespoke databases and interfaces and/or want to create Linked Open Data. 
This repository documents various possible ways of extracting, processing, reshaping and reusing data held in a Wikibase, in the hope that it may be useful for people working with similar material.  

It includes material like:

- an overview of the Wikibase > SPARQL > R workflow used for data analysis

- code and notes on use of an API to get women's names data from ISNI

- documentation, code and data for the creation of a bibliographic dataset of BN women's publications

- code for the creation of short narrative biographies from the wikibase data

- notes/code on particularly complex aspects of working with the wikibase such as handling dates and geographical information
